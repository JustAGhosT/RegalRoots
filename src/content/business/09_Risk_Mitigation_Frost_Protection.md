# 9. Risk & Mitigation Strategies (Frost, Water, Market)

## 9.1 Frost Protection

- **Late Planting**: Start Moringa in September 2025, after the last likely frost.  
- **Row Covers / Frost Cloth**: Protect young Dragonfruit cacti if nighttime temps drop near 1–2°C.  
- **Mulch & Windbreaks**: Minimizes heat loss at ground level, breaks cold wind.  
- **Resilient Varieties**: Seek locally adapted Moringa seeds known to handle mild frost.  
- **Contingency**: If a freeze kills top growth, Moringa often resprouts from the root. Prune dead stems and wait for spring.

## 9.2 Water Scarcity

- **Rainwater Harvesting**: Guttering on any shed or structure to store in tanks.  
- **Efficient Irrigation**: Drip or targeted watering, especially for Lucerne in winter.  
- **Scheduling**: Moringa’s main thirst is first 3 months; after that, it can endure short droughts.  
- **Backup Borehole**: If feasible, test yield for partial water security.

## 9.3 Market Uncertainty

- **Diversification**: If Moringa powder demand dips, Lucerne or vegetables keep cash flow.  
- **Local Partnerships**: Build relationships with feed stores, restaurants, health shops early.  
- **Value-Added**: If fresh leaves/pods sell slowly, convert them to dried powder or tea with longer shelf life.  
- **Marketing Budget**: Allocate some funds for small ads, social media, packaging upgrades.

## 9.4 Pest & Disease

- **Scouting**: Weekly checks for aphids, caterpillars, fungal spots.  
- **Organic Sprays**: Neem oil, biological controls.  
- **Lucerne**: Watch for leafhoppers or root rot if waterlogged.  
- **Dragonfruit**: Avoid overwatering to prevent rot; netting if birds or fruit bats attack.  

## 9.5 Financial Risk

- **Maintain Cash Buffer**: Enough to cover 6–9 months of Opex in Year 1.  
- **Stagger Investments**: Don’t over-expand Dragonfruit or Moringa too fast without confirmed sales.  
- **Monitor ROI**: Reinvest only if each crop’s net margin is satisfactory.
