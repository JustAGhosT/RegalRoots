# 8. Distribution & Sales Strategy

## 8.1 Distribution Channels

1. **Direct to Consumer**  
   - Farmer’s market stalls (weekends in Bela Bela, Pretoria)  
   - On-farm sales or local pickups  
   - Online (social media, farm website) for Moringa powder shipping

2. **Retail & Health Shops**  
   - Approach health food stores, pharmacies for Moringa powder, capsules  
   - Smaller grocers for fresh produce (drumstick pods, veggies)

3. **Bulk Buyers**  
   - Lucerne: local livestock farmers, stables, feed stores  
   - Moringa powder in bulk to supplement companies or animal feed mixers  
   - Dragonfruit to specialty fruit distributors or high-end grocers

4. **Collaboration**  
   - Restaurants using Dragonfruit or fresh Moringa leaves in signature dishes  
   - Co-ops or associations for shared marketing (e.g., Moringa Development Association of SA)

## 8.2 Branding & Promotion

- **“Regal Roots Farm”** branding: Emphasize sustainability, local pride (Bela Bela), and superfood benefits  
- **Labeling**: Clear packaging, “proudly Limpopo” or “hand-harvested in Bela Bela”  
- **Events & Workshops**: Host small farm tours, Moringa health demos

## 8.3 Pricing Strategy

- **Premium Pricing**: For Moringa powder and Dragonfruit, position as specialty items  
- **Competitive Pricing**: Lucerne aligns with local feed market rates  
- **Seasonal Promotions**: E.g., “Dragonfruit harvest special” to build excitement
