- Lucerne can be sown in late winter/early spring (Aug–Sep) or mid-summer if conditions allow. Cuts happen ~every 6–8 weeks in the growing season.  
- Dragonfruit is slow to first fruit (~Year 2), so initial tasks revolve around building trellises, planting, training vines, and frost protection.  
- Moringa’s first big leaf harvest is ~6–8 months after planting, so if planted in Sep 2025, major leaf harvest around Mar–Apr 2026.

### Further Improvements

- **Color Coding & Legends:**  
  Consider adding color coding in the Mermaid code (using custom styling or tasks) and include a legend for clarity.

- **Detailed Milestones:**  
  If you have more specific dates (e.g., for irrigation system tests or seed quality checks), add them to provide a clearer roadmap.

- **Phased Implementation Notes:**  
  Use `%%` comments or custom lines in the Gantt code to highlight Phase 1 results or expansions for Year 2–3.

- **Visual Enhancements:**  
  If desired, embed an image or link from a project management tool to complement the interactive Mermaid chart.
