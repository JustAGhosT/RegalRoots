# Lessons Learned

This document summarizes critical insights gained from early trial phases and outlines adjustments to enhance farm management and crop strategies moving forward.

## 1. Lucerne Test Run

- **Trial Overview:**  
  A 20×20 m (0.04 ha) lucerne test was conducted during Phase 1.
- **Outcome:**  
  The test run was unsuccessful due to insufficient manual input after sowing, which led to poor stand establishment.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Effective manual management—such as regular irrigation, timely weeding, and ensuring proper seeding depth—is essential for crops like lucerne that demand consistent care.

## 2. Labor Management

- **Observation:**  
  Early trials highlighted the critical need for dedicated labor during planting and early growth stages.
- **Action:**  
  Our core operations will be **mostly family-run** by Robs, Mojo, Jurie, and the twins, supplemented by hired help during peak periods.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  A robust labor plan with clear task delegation is vital to ensure that no critical steps are neglected, particularly during the establishment phase.

## 3. Crop Yield Estimates

- **Data Review:**  
  Preliminary yield estimates showed significant variation among crops:
  - **Moringa:** Potential to yield over 6 tons of dry leaves per hectare with proper management.
  - **Lucerne:** Can achieve 15–20 tons/ha under optimal conditions, though success depends on consistent manual care.
  - **Dragonfruit:** Requires 2+ years before fruiting, but offers high returns once fully established.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Yield estimates must be continually refined with local data, ongoing management feedback, and market conditions to ensure realistic projections.

## 4. Diversification & Risk

- **Diversification Strategy:**  
  Incorporating additional crops such as sweet potatoes, herbs, and prickly pear helps mitigate risks if a primary crop underperforms.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  A diversified crop portfolio supports steady income and improves soil health. Phased expansion and small-scale trials for new crops enable iterative learning and better risk management.

## 5. Infrastructure and Equipment

- **Observation:**  
  Early trials underscored the importance of investing in proper irrigation, fencing, and support structures (especially for Dragonfruit).
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Essential infrastructure investments—like drip irrigation systems, frost cloth, and trellises—are non-negotiable. Allocating upfront capital to these areas is critical for long-term crop success.

## 6. Market and Financial Considerations

- **Observation:**  
  Limited market data and financial projections from early trials have made it challenging to pinpoint revenue potentials and cost structures accurately.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Continuous market analysis and the use of both conservative and highline financial models are necessary to adapt our strategy and secure profitability over time.

By integrating these lessons into our strategy, we are better equipped to optimize labor management, enhance crop yields, and diversify effectively. Future phases will leverage these insights to improve overall management practices, invest in critical infrastructure, and adapt crop distribution based on real-world performance, ensuring the long-term sustainability and profitability of our farm.
