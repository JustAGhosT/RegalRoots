## 3.1 Moringa Farming

**Key Points**  
- **Timelines**: First leaf harvest ~6–8 months after planting; full production by Year 2.  
- **Water**: Low requirement once established, but crucial in first 3–6 months.  
- **Market**: Leaf powder, tea, seeds, pods. High-value superfood.  
- **Planting**: ~September 2025 to leverage rains. Direct seed or nursery start.  
- **Harvest & Processing**: Manual leaf harvest, sun/air-dry, mill into powder.  
- **Strengths**: Quick payback, high margin, minimal mechanization.

## 3.2 Lucerne (Alfalfa)

**Key Points**  
- **Timelines**: 3–4 months to first cut, multiple cuts per year if irrigated.  
- **Water**: High irrigation demand. Without consistent water, yields drop.  
- **Market**: Commodity feed (hay bales). Steady local demand but price fluctuations.  
- **Planting**: Sow seeds in spring (Aug–Sept). Possibly again in late summer if re-seeding.  
- **Harvest & Baling**: Typically 4–5 cuts/year. Manual or mechanical.  
- **Strengths**: Reliable fodder for local livestock; established market channels.

## 3.3 Dragonfruit (Pitaya)

**Key Points**  
- **Timelines**: 2+ years to first significant fruit, peak yields around Year 4.  
- **Water**: Moderate, avoid waterlogging. Tolerates dryness but needs irrigation for good fruit.  
- **Market**: Niche fruit, sold at premium. Potentially high profit if local or export market is tapped.  
- **Infrastructure**: Requires trellises/posts. Frost sensitive.  
- **Strengths**: High potential return per hectare, exotic product, can fetch R50–R60/kg or more.
