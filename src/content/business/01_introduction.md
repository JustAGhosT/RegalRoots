# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose & Goals

This plan outlines the creation of a **small-scale farm** in Bela Bela, South Africa, primarily centered on **Moringa oleifera**, with secondary crops **Lucerne** and **Dragonfruit**. Our objectives include:

- **Generate Steady Income**  
  Establish multiple revenue streams to ensure consistent cash flow.

- **Leverage Local Climate**  
  Utilize Bela Bela’s warm weather and moderate rainfall for sustainable, cost-effective operations.

- **Diversify Risk**  
  Balance quick-return crops (e.g., Moringa) with mid- and long-term ventures (Lucerne fodder and Dragonfruit orchard).

- **Achieve Early Break-Even**  
  Target a break-even point within the first year via Moringa, while developing Lucerne and Dragonfruit for continued gains.

## 1.2 Why Bela Bela?

- **Warm Subtropical Climate**  
  Ideal for heat-loving crops like Moringa and Dragonfruit, though winter frost must be carefully managed.

- **Moderate Rainfall (~400–500 mm)**  
  Sufficient for partial rain-fed cultivation, supplemented by minimal irrigation in drier months.

- **Market Access**  
  Proximity to Pretoria and Johannesburg provides large consumer bases and weekend markets for direct or wholesale sales.

## 1.3 Scope of This Plan

This business plan covers:

- **Land, Soil & Climate**  
  Detailed considerations of Bela Bela’s environment, ensuring each crop thrives under local conditions.

- **Crop-Specific Details**  
  Step-by-step guidelines for Moringa (primary), Lucerne (secondary fodder), and Dragonfruit (high-value orchard).

- **Additional Crops**  
  Exploration of short-season vegetables (e.g., sweet potatoes, butternut), herbs, prickly pear, pomegranates, and other options for resilience.

- **Gantt Timelines**  
  Refer to [`Timelines`](./10_gantt_timelines.md) for a detailed schedule of tasks (land prep, planting, harvesting) across Year 1–3.

- **Labor & Agronomic Practices**  
  See [`Labor Practices`](./12_labor_agronomic_practices.md) for workforce requirements, planting methods, and soil health guidelines.  
  This farm is mostly **family-run** by Robs, Mojo, Jurie, and potentially the twins (if/when they focus), with occasional hired help if needed.

- **Market & Financial Analysis**  
  Local and national demand, cost projections, highline vs. pessimistic income scenarios, and break-even strategies.

- **SWOT & Risk Mitigation**  
  Identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, and measures against frost, pests, and water scarcity.

Together, these components form a **comprehensive roadmap** for establishing a profitable, diversified small-scale farm in Bela Bela—leveraging the region’s climate while protecting against potential risks and ensuring a **steady path to sustainability**.
