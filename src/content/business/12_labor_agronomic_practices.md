# 12. Labor & Agronomic Practices

This section outlines best practices for managing labor, planting, pruning, and maintaining soil health on our farm. With a focus on a **mostly family-run operation** (led by Robs, Mojo, Jurie), these guidelines are designed to maximize efficiency and ensure sustainable crop production.

## 12.1 Workforce Management

- **Family-Run Core:**  
  Our operation is primarily managed by family members, including Robs, Mojo, and Jurie who share responsibilities across planting, maintenance, and harvesting.
  
- **Seasonal Assistance:**  
  - Hire additional labor during peak periods (e.g., planting, harvesting, and processing).  
  - Provide training to new helpers to ensure they adhere to best practices and maintain quality.

- **Task Scheduling:**  
  - Establish clear daily and weekly routines.  
  - Use a shared calendar to track tasks such as irrigation, weeding, pruning, and harvesting to avoid overlap and ensure no task is neglected.

## 12.2 Planting Guidelines

- **Site Preparation:**  
  - Prepare the soil by incorporating compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and moisture retention.  
  - Ensure proper tillage and weed removal to create a fine seedbed for optimal seed-to-soil contact.

- **Seeding & Transplanting:**  
  - **Moringa:** Plant in September 2025 after the last frost; consider direct seeding or starting in a nursery.  
  - **Lucerne:** Sow in early spring (Aug–Sept), ensuring seeds are planted at a shallow depth (0.5–1 cm) and spaced to allow for healthy root development.  
  - **Dragonfruit:** Plant cuttings once trellises and frost protection measures are in place.

- **Phased Implementation:**  
  - Start with small test plots (e.g., the initial 20×20 m trial for Lucerne) to optimize planting methods and adjust labor requirements before scaling to larger areas.

## 12.3 Pruning & Crop Maintenance

- **Moringa:**  
  - **Early Pruning:** Begin topping plants when they reach 60–90 cm to encourage branching and a bushy structure for increased leaf production.  
  - **Regular Maintenance:** Prune dead or damaged growth to promote healthy regrowth and prevent disease.

- **Lucerne:**  
  - **Timely Cutting:** Schedule lucerne cuts every 6–8 weeks during the growing season.  
  - **Post-Harvest Care:** Ensure proper drying and storage of hay to maintain quality and prevent spoilage.

- **Dragonfruit:**  
  - **Vine Training:** Gently guide and secure vines to trellises, ensuring they receive adequate sunlight and air circulation.  
  - **Frost Protection:** Regularly inspect and apply frost cloth or other protective measures during cold nights.

## 12.4 Soil Health Management

- **Fertility Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly add organic matter (compost or manure) to replenish nutrients and improve soil structure.  
  - Monitor soil pH periodically; adjust with lime or sulfur as needed to maintain optimal levels (pH 6.5–7.5).

- **Irrigation Management:**  
  - Use efficient drip or targeted irrigation systems to conserve water and reduce runoff in sandy loam soils.
  - Adjust watering schedules based on crop needs—intensive watering is critical during initial growth, with reduced frequency as crops mature.

- **Weed & Pest Control:**  
  - Implement regular scouting and timely intervention using organic or biological controls.  
  - Maintain clear rows and use mulching to suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.

### Final Considerations

By adhering to these labor and agronomic practices, our farm will not only optimize crop production but also create a sustainable and resilient operation. Leveraging a family-run model ensures personalized management and flexibility, while seasonal hiring supports increased demand during peak periods. Consistent maintenance of soil health and crop-specific practices will be key to long-term success.
