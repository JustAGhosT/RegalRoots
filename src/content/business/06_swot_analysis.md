# 6. SWOT Analysis

This analysis examines the internal and external factors that affect our diversified farm venture in Bela Bela.

| **Strengths**                                                                 | **Weaknesses**                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Low startup cost for Moringa                                                | - Limited irrigation infrastructure for lucerne and large-scale expansion  |
| - Bela Bela’s warm climate ideally suited for Moringa and moderately for other crops | - Dragonfruit’s long lead time (2+ years before significant yield)         |
| - High-value market for Moringa products                                      | - Niche market that requires focused, targeted marketing                   |
| - Potential to break even in Year 1 for Moringa                                | - Labor-intensive harvest and processing without sufficient mechanization   |
| - Diversification strategy spreads risk across multiple crops                 | - Susceptibility to frost damage if protective measures are inadequate        |

| **Opportunities**                                                             | **Threats**                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Growing health-conscious consumer base boosting demand for superfoods       | - Price volatility in the lucerne and livestock feed markets               |
| - Premium local and export markets for Dragonfruit                            | - Drought and water restrictions potentially reducing yields              |
| - Expansion into additional crops (herbs, pomegranates, short-season vegetables such as sweet potatoes) | - Increased competition from other Moringa producers and niche crop growers |
| - Opportunities in agro-tourism and farm-based educational tours              | - Market oversupply if too many farmers adopt similar superfood strategies   |

This SWOT analysis provides a clear overview of our farm's potential advantages and challenges, guiding strategic decisions for risk mitigation and market positioning.
