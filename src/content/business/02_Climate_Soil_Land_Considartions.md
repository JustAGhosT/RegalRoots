# 2. Climate, Soil & Land Considerations

## 2.1 Climate Overview

- **Hot Summers**: 30–33°C highs, ideal for Moringa’s rapid growth and Dragonfruit’s fruit set.  
- **Dry Winters**: Frost risk is low but possible. Lucerne remains green with irrigation; Moringa slows down; Dragonfruit requires minimal watering but needs frost protection.  
- **Rainfall**: ~450 mm/year, mostly Oct–Mar. Moringa can thrive with as little as 250 mm, but additional water ensures higher leaf yield.

## 2.2 Soil Suitability

- **Soil Type**: Sandy loam common in Bela Bela, which drains well.  
- **Moringa**: Prefers well-drained soil, tolerates low fertility.  
- **Lucerne**: Needs deeper, neutral pH soil; can be grown if fertilized adequately.  
- **Dragonfruit**: Requires well-drained, slightly acidic to neutral soil. Minimal waterlogging.  
- **Key Action**: Add compost or manure to improve fertility and moisture retention. Avoid waterlogged spots.

## 2.3 Land Allocation

- **Approx. 1 ha** total (example). Proposed distribution:  
  - Lucerne: 0.5 ha  
  - Moringa: 0.3 ha  
  - Dragonfruit: 0.2 ha  
  - (Adjust as needed based on actual land size and results.)

## 2.4 Frost Protection & Offset Areas

- **Frost Strategy**: 
  - Delay Moringa planting until after last frost (Sept 2025).  
  - Use frost cloth on young Dragonfruit cacti or a protective structure.  
  - If a severe frost hits, Moringa can resprout from the base; keep trunk mulched.  
- **Offset Areas**: 
  - If Bela Bela experiences repeated frosts, consider small orchard in a warmer microclimate or pivot to other hardy crops (e.g., pomegranates, prickly pear).
