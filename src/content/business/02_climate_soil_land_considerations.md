# 2. Climate, Soil & Land Considerations

## 2.1 Climate Overview

- **Hot Summers**: Daily highs of 30–33°C are ideal for rapid Moringa growth and effective Dragonfruit fruit set.
- **Dry Winters**: Although frost risk is low, mild frosts can occur. Lucerne remains green with proper irrigation, Moringa’s growth slows, and Dragonfruit needs careful frost protection.
- **Rainfall**: Approximately 450 mm annually (mostly October–March). Moringa thrives with as little as 250 mm, but supplemental irrigation boosts leaf yield.

## 2.2 Soil Suitability

- **Soil Type**: Bela Bela’s sandy loam soils are well-draining and conducive to healthy root development.
- **Moringa**: Prefers well-drained, low-fertility soils; thrives with added organic matter.
- **Lucerne**: Requires deeper, neutral pH soils; improved fertility via compost enhances growth.
- **Dragonfruit**: Needs well-drained soils with a slightly acidic to neutral pH to prevent waterlogging.
- **Key Action**: Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and moisture retention while avoiding waterlogged areas.

## 2.3 Land Allocation

- **Total Area**: Example of 1 ha.
- **Proposed Distribution**:
  - **Lucerne**: 0.5 ha for consistent fodder production.
  - **Moringa**: 0.3 ha, ideally placed in well-drained sections.
  - **Dragonfruit**: 0.2 ha, ideally in the warmest, most sheltered corner.
- *(Adjust proportions based on actual land size and production goals.)*

## 2.4 Frost Protection & Offset Areas

- **Frost Strategy**:
  - Delay Moringa planting until after the last frost (targeting September 2025).
  - Use frost cloth or protective structures for young Dragonfruit cacti.
  - In the event of severe frost, allow Moringa to resprout from the base—ensure trunks are well mulched.
- **Offset Areas**:
  - If repeated frosts become an issue, consider establishing a small orchard in a naturally warmer microclimate.
  - Alternatively, pivot to more frost-tolerant crops (such as pomegranates or prickly pear) in affected sections.
