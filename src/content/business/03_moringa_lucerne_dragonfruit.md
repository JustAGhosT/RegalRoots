## 3.1 Moringa Farming

**Key Points:**

- **Timelines:**  
  - First leaf harvest expected ~6–8 months after planting.  
  - Full production is projected to be reached by Year 2.
  
- **Water Needs:**  
  - Low water requirements once established, but critical for the initial 3–6 months.
  
- **Market Potential:**  
  - High-value superfood with multiple products: leaf powder, tea, seeds, and pods.
  
- **Planting Strategy:**  
  - Aim to plant in September 2025 to take full advantage of the rainy season.  
  - Options include direct seeding or starting in a nursery.
  
- **Harvest & Processing:**  
  - Manual leaf harvest followed by sun/air-drying and milling into powder.
  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Quick payback potential and high profit margins with minimal mechanization required.

## 3.2 Lucerne (Alfalfa)

**Key Points:**

- **Timelines:**  
  - First cut typically occurs within 3–4 months of sowing.  
  - Multiple harvests (usually 4–5 cuts per year) are achievable with proper irrigation.
  
- **Water Needs:**  
  - High irrigation demand; consistent water supply is essential for maintaining yield.
  
- **Market Potential:**  
  - A steady, established market for hay bales as livestock feed, though subject to price fluctuations.
  
- **Planting Strategy:**  
  - Sow seeds in early spring (around August–September), with the possibility of a second sowing in late summer if re-seeding is required.
  
- **Harvest & Baling:**  
  - Harvesting may be done manually or mechanically, depending on scale and resource availability.
  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Reliable fodder crop with well-established market channels among local livestock producers.

## 3.3 Dragonfruit (Pitaya)

**Key Points:**

- **Timelines:**  
  - Expect 2+ years before the first significant fruiting, with peak yields typically reached around Year 4.
  
- **Water Needs:**  
  - Moderate water requirements; careful irrigation is needed to avoid waterlogging while supporting fruit development.
  
- **Market Potential:**  
  - An exotic, niche fruit that can command premium prices (R50–R60/kg or higher) in both local and export markets.
  
- **Infrastructure:**  
  - Requires the installation of trellises and posts, along with diligent frost protection measures, as Dragonfruit is highly frost-sensitive.
  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Offers high potential return per hectare if market conditions are favorable, making it a valuable long-term investment.
