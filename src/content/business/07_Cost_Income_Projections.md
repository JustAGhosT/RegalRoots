# 7. Cost Analysis & Income Projections

This section compares **best-case (highline)** vs. **pessimistic** scenarios. All figures in ZAR.

## 7.1 Startup Costs (Example for ~1 ha)

| **Item**           | **Estimated Cost** | **Notes**                                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Land Preparation   | R2,000            | Clearing, ploughing (tractor hire)                                |
| Irrigation Setup   | R6,000            | Basic pump, drip lines or sprinklers, 1–2k L tank                 |
| Fencing            | R4,000            | Protect 1 ha from livestock                                       |
| Seeds/Saplings     | R2,000            | Moringa seeds, lucerne seeds, some dragonfruit cuttings           |
| Tools & Equipment  | R2,000            | Hand tools, small processing gear (drying racks)                  |
| Contingency        | R2,000            | Unforeseen expenses                                               |
| **Total Startup**  | **~R18,000**      | Within the R10k–R20k range                                        |

## 7.2 Annual Operating Costs

| **Category**       | **Est. Annual Cost** | **Notes**                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Irrigation & Water | R3,000 – R5,000     | Pump electricity, municipal charges if any                     |
| Fertilizer/Compost | R1,000 – R2,000     | Organic matter for Moringa, more for Lucerne                   |
| Pest Control       | R500                | Neem oil, minor organic insecticides                           |
| Labor              | R4,000 – R6,000     | Seasonal help (harvest, baling, processing)                    |
| Packaging/Transport| R2,000              | Bags, jars, local deliveries                                   |
| Misc. Maintenance  | R1,000              | Fencing, tool repair, etc.                                     |
| **Total Opex**     | **~R12k – R16k**    | Varies by scale & mechanization                                |

## 7.3 Income Projections

### 7.3.1 Moringa Focus (0.3 ha)

- **Year 1**:  
  - Leaf yield ~200 kg dry (late first harvest) at R150/kg = **R30,000**  
  - Operating costs ~R12,000 → Net ~R18,000  
  - Break-even on startup possible if combined with other income  

- **Year 2**:  
  - Leaf yield ~800 kg at R150/kg = **R120,000**  
  - Net ~R105,000 after Opex  
  - Seeds/pods could add another R2k–R5k  

### 7.3.2 Lucerne (0.5 ha)

- 4–5 cuts/year, ~2–3 tons each cut if well irrigated → ~10–12 tons total  
- Price ~R2,500/t = **~R25,000 – R30,000** gross  
- Net might be ~R15k after water, labor, baling costs  

### 7.3.3 Dragonfruit (0.2 ha)

- **Year 1**: Minimal or no income; plants establishing  
- **Year 2**: Light fruiting, ~500 kg total at R50/kg = **R25,000**  
- **Year 3+**: Possibly 1,500+ kg = R75,000 or more, scaling each year. Some farms reach 15+ t/ha eventually, but we only have 0.2 ha.  

## 7.4 Highline vs. Pessimistic

| **Scenario** | **Year 1**                    | **Year 2**                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Highline** | Moringa 200 kg @ R150/kg = R30k <br> Lucerne ~R15k net <br> Dragonfruit ~R0 <br> **Total ~R45k** revenue, ~R30k net after Opex. Enough to break even on R18k startup. | Moringa 800 kg @ R150/kg = R120k <br> Lucerne ~R20k net <br> Dragonfruit ~R25k <br> **Total ~R165k** revenue, net ~R145k. Very profitable. |
| **Pessimistic** | Moringa only 100 kg @ R100/kg = R10k <br> Lucerne yields lower (maybe R10k net) <br> Dragonfruit no fruit yet <br> **Total ~R20k** revenue, net ~R10k. May not fully recoup startup in Year 1. | Moringa 500 kg @ R100/kg = R50k <br> Lucerne ~R15k net <br> Dragonfruit minimal = R10k <br> **Total ~R75k** revenue, net ~R60k. Break-even in Year 2. |

Even in the pessimistic scenario, the farm likely breaks even by Year 2, while the highline scenario shows substantial profitability. The key risk is **finding buyers** for Moringa and dealing with possible irrigation shortfalls for lucerne.
