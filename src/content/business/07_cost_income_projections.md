# 7. Cost Analysis & Income Projections

This section presents a detailed financial breakdown for our diversified farm, comparing **best-case (highline)** and **pessimistic** scenarios. All figures are in ZAR and are based on a 1-hectare pilot operation for crops.

| Packaging/Transport| R2,000               | Bags, jars, local deliveries                                    |
| Misc. Maintenance  | R1,000               | Fencing repairs, tool upkeep                                    |
| **Total Opex**     | **~R12,000 – R16,000** | Varies with scale and level of mechanization                     |

## 7.3 Income Projections

### 7.3.1 Moringa Focus (0.3 ha)

- **Year 1:**  
  - Leaf yield ~200 kg dry (late first harvest) at R150/kg = **R30,000**  
  - Operating costs ~R12,000 → **Net: ~R18,000**  
  - Break-even on startup is achievable when combined with other revenue streams.

- **Year 2:**  
  - Leaf yield ~800 kg at R150/kg = **R120,000**  
  - After operating expenses, net income is **~R105,000**  
  - Additional income from seeds/pods could add another R2,000–R5,000.

### 7.3.2 Lucerne (0.5 ha)

- Estimated 4–5 cuts per year, with each cut yielding roughly 2–3 tons, totaling approximately **10–12 tons** per hectare.  
- At a market price of ~R2,500 per ton, gross revenue is **~R25,000–R30,000**.  
- After accounting for water, labor, and baling costs, net income may be around **R15,000**.

### 7.3.3 Dragonfruit (0.2 ha)

- **Year 1:**  
  - Minimal or no income as plants establish.
- **Year 2:**  
  - Light fruiting yields approximately 500 kg at R50/kg, equaling **R25,000**.
- **Year 3+:**  
  - Scaling yields can produce 1,500+ kg, resulting in **R75,000** or more annually.
  - Note: Some farms report yields of up to 15+ tons/ha at full production, but our area is limited to 0.2 ha.

## 7.4 Highline vs. Pessimistic Scenarios

| **Scenario** | **Year 1**                                                                                                                                      | **Year 2**                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Highline** | - Moringa: 200 kg @ R150/kg = R30k<br>- Lucerne: ~R15k net<br>- Dragonfruit: ~R0<br>**Total Revenue:** ~R45k, **Net:** ~R30k (Break-even on ~R18k startup) | - Moringa: 800 kg @ R150/kg = R120k<br>- Lucerne: ~R20k net<br>- Dragonfruit: ~R25k<br>**Total Revenue:** ~R165k, **Net:** ~R145k  |
| **Pessimistic** | - Moringa: 100 kg @ R100/kg = R10k<br>- Lucerne: ~R10k net<br>- Dragonfruit: no yield<br>**Total Revenue:** ~R20k, **Net:** ~R10k (Insufficient for Year 1) | - Moringa: 500 kg @ R100/kg = R50k<br>- Lucerne: ~R15k net<br>- Dragonfruit: minimal yield = R10k<br>**Total Revenue:** ~R75k, **Net:** ~R60k (Break-even by Year 2) |

Even in the pessimistic scenario, the farm is expected to break even by Year 2. The highline scenario projects significant profitability. Key risks include finding consistent buyers for Moringa and managing irrigation for lucerne.

### Final Summary

This financial model demonstrates that with an initial startup investment of approximately **R18,000** and annual operating costs of **R12,000–R16,000**, the farm has the potential to achieve early break-even and substantial net income, particularly if Moringa performs well. Scaling operations and diversifying income through additional crops will further enhance profitability and mitigate risks.

### Next Steps

- **Refine Yield Data:** Continuously update yield estimates based on actual performance and local research.
- **Monitor Market Prices:** Adjust pricing strategies as market conditions evolve.
- **Enhance Infrastructure:** Invest in efficient irrigation and processing equipment as production scales.
- **Secure Buyers:** Build robust marketing channels to ensure consistent sales, especially for high-value Moringa products.
