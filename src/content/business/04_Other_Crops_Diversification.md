# 4. Additional Crops & Diversification

## 4.1 Potential Alternatives

- **Pomegranates**: Hardy fruit tree, 3–4 years to fruit, moderate water, frost-tolerant. Good local & export market.  
- **Prickly Pear**: Very drought-resistant, spineless varieties produce fruit + fodder pads. Minimal input.  
- **Herbs (Rosemary, Lavender)**: Low water needs, can be grown along edges or as windbreak. Market for essential oils or fresh herb bundles.  
- **Short-Season Vegetables**: Butternut, sweet potato, watermelon. Provide quicker cash flow, but require more labor.  
- **Fodder Grains (Teff, Sunflower)**: Rotation with lucerne or a fallback if water is limited.

## 4.2 Why Diversify?

1. **Risk Mitigation**: If Moringa underperforms or frost damages Dragonfruit, fallback crops sustain income.  
2. **Market Opportunities**: Additional products (herbs, vegetables) can be sold at local markets or to restaurants.  
3. **Soil Health**: Rotating short-season crops with lucerne or Moringa can improve fertility, break pest cycles.

## 4.3 Crop Distribution

An example approach on 1 ha:

- **Lucerne**: 0.5 ha  
- **Moringa**: 0.3 ha  
- **Dragonfruit**: 0.2 ha  
- **Small experimental plots** for vegetables/herbs (e.g., 0.05–0.1 ha) interspersed if total land extends beyond 1 ha or within row gaps.
