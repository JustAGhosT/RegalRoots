# 10. Gantt-Like Timelines

> **Assumption**: We are at end of Feb 2025. Optimal planting for Moringa is Sept 2025. This timeline covers Year 0 (preparation) through Year 3. Simplified ASCII version below:

```
Year 0 (Mar–Aug 2025): 
  [Land Prep & Infrastructure]
    Mar-Apr |--- Clear land, fence, plan irrigation ---|
    May-Jun |--- Install irrigation, gather seeds/cuttings ---|
    Jul-Aug |--- Build Dragonfruit trellis, finalize seed nursery ---|

Year 1 (Sep 2025–Aug 2026):
  [Moringa Establishment]
    Sep-Oct |--- Plant Moringa seeds/nursery transplants ---|
    Nov-Dec |--- Watering & weeding (heavy rains start) ---|
    Jan-Feb |--- Light harvest #1 (leaf) + Lucerne first cut if sown in Sep ---|
    Mar-Apr |--- Moringa growth, 2nd Lucerne cut, Dragonfruit cacti care ---|
    May-Jun |--- Evaluate partial harvest of Moringa leaves, possible dryness ---|
    Jul-Aug |--- Off-season maintenance, frost watch, potential minimal Lucerne cut --|

Year 2 (Sep 2026–Aug 2027):
  [Moringa Full Production Begins, Lucerne cyclical cuts, Early Dragonfruit]
    Sep-Nov |--- Major leaf harvest #1, sow/renew Lucerne if needed ---|
    Dec-Jan |--- Leaf harvest #2, Lucerne cut #2 or #3, first small Dragonfruit yield? ---|
    Feb-Mar |--- Market Moringa powder, store/pack Dragonfruit, possibly 3rd Moringa harvest ---|
    Apr-Jun |--- Off-season, pruning, frost risk, minor watering, expand any extra crops ---|
    Jul-Aug |--- Summarize Year 2 finances, plan expansions or re-planting --|

Year 3 (Sep 2027–Aug 2028):
  [Scaling & Stabilization]
    Sep-Dec |--- Dragonfruit larger harvest, Moringa repeated leaf harvest cycles ---|
    Jan-Feb |--- Possibly 2–3 Moringa harvest cycles per year, Lucerne stable cuts ---|
    Mar-Jun |--- Evaluate expansions (more Moringa or orchard?), re-invest profits ---|
    Jul-Aug |--- By now, Dragonfruit orchard in real production, Moringa near peak yield ---|
```

**Note**:  
- Lucerne can be sown in late winter/early spring (Aug–Sep) or mid-summer if conditions allow. Cuts happen ~every 6–8 weeks in the growing season.  
- Dragonfruit is slow to first fruit (~Year 2), so initial tasks revolve around building trellises, planting, training vines, and frost protection.  
- Moringa’s first big leaf harvest is ~6–8 months after planting, so if planted in Sep 2025, major leaf harvest around Mar–Apr 2026.
