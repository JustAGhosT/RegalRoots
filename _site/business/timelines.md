# Timelines

## Timelines from Setup to First Harvest and Beyond

A clear timeline will help manage the farm from initial setup through ongoing production:

### Month 0 – 1 (Preparation & Planting)

Select and clear a suitable plot, conduct soil tests, and prepare the land (remove weeds, plough or dig in compost). Aim to plant Moringa at the start of the rainy season (around September/October in Bela Bela) to leverage natural rainfall. Sow seeds directly in the field or establish saplings in a nursery for transplanting after the last frost. Germination occurs within 1–2 weeks if soil is warm and moist.

### Month 2 – 3 (Establishment)

Seedlings emerge and begin establishing roots. Water every 3 days for the first 3 months to ensure strong growth. Keep fields weed-free and protect young plants from pests or grazing animals. By the end of Month 3, seedlings should be 30–50 cm tall with a developing taproot.

### Month 4 – 6 (Early Growth)

Plants grow rapidly in warm summer conditions, often reaching 1.5–2 m by 6 months under good conditions. Continue irrigation during dry spells and begin light pruning to encourage branching. Initial leaf harvests can start about 6–8 months after planting, once trees are ~2 m tall. At this stage, focus on harvesting leaves (pinch or cut branches 0.5 m above ground) rather than pods, since flowering/fruiting in the first year is minimal.

### Months 7 – 12 (First Harvests)

Conduct the first major leaf harvest around Month 6–8, drying and processing leaves into powder or tea. After the first cut, Moringa regrows quickly; a second leaf harvest is possible by Month 12. (Note: If trees are grown from cuttings instead of seeds, first harvest might occur slightly earlier, but timeline is similar.) By the end of Year 1, each tree will have produced a modest amount of leaves; fruiting (pods) is rare in the first year.

### Year 2 (Full Production Begins)

Trees become well-established and more productive. Expect significantly larger leaf yields and the first pods (drumsticks) by Year 2, as Moringa typically begins substantial pod production in the second year. Each mature tree might produce on the order of a few hundred pods in Year 2 under good care. Plan for 2–3 leaf harvest cycles per year (e.g. early summer, mid-summer, and autumn) if irrigation is available, since regular pruning encourages continuous leaf output.

### Year 3 and Beyond (Scaling & Sustained Harvests)

By Year 3, trees reach peak or near-peak production. A healthy tree can yield 300+ pods in Year 2 and around 1,000 pods by Year 3 under ideal conditions. Leaf production also increases with the larger tree canopy. Continue a cycle of pruning and harvesting leaves every few months. The orchard can remain productive for many years (Moringa is a perennial tree) with proper pruning and care. At this stage, consider expanding the farm or intercropping if market demand supports it. Regularly evaluate yields and market prices to plan any scaling of operations.

Tip: Timing planting with the rainy season (spring/summer) in Bela Bela is crucial. Bela Bela receives ~400–500 mm of rain annually, mostly between October and March. This natural rainfall will reduce initial irrigation needs and help young Moringa trees establish quickly. During the dry winter months (May–September), growth will slow and additional irrigation may be needed for continued leaf production or to keep trees healthy.
