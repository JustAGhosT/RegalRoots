- A spacing of 2.5–3 meters between trees is recommended for optimal growth.
- A plot of 1 hectare can accommodate approximately 1,000–1,200 trees.

### Water Requirements

- Drip irrigation is recommended to ensure efficient water use.
- During the rainy season, natural rainfall can reduce the need for additional irrigation.
